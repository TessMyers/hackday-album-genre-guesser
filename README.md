Hackathon, don't judge me

Run
```
node server.js
```
or development server

```
nodemon server.js
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000/`. Paste an image url into the url box, and click "download". 
This will download the image at that URL to the /images folder. Click "guess genre" and absolutely nothing happens yet.
